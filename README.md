## Brief of project:-
During this covid-19 pandemic, we know how important it is to wear a mask, this project helps to determine whether the person is wearing a mask or not and also determines its accuracy. In front of the camera if a red box appears on the face it means person is not wearing a mask, if greens box appears it means person is wearing a mask and accuracy is shown on the top of the box.
